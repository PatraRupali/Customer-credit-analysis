# Credit Data Analysis & Score Development
## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and the development of a **hypothetical credit scoring system** using a dataset containing customer details and credit-related information. The primary goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, identify potential risks, and provide data-driven insights that can guide **credit risk mitigation strategies**. This analysis will help simulate a credit scoring model based on real-world credit industry standards.

## Key Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the data structure, distributions, and relationships among various features.
   - Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Visualize data trends using tools like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create 5-10 new, informative features based on domain knowledge and EDA findings.
   - Aggregate customer-level features to ensure a more robust analysis of creditworthiness.
   - Ensure that the new features contribute significantly to the prediction of credit risk.

3. **Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation**:
   - Develop a scoring methodology inspired by credit industry standards (e.g., **FICO score**).
   - Assign appropriate weightage to each feature and calculate the **hypothetical credit score** for each customer.

4. **Insights and Analysis**:
   - Identify key factors influencing creditworthiness.
   - Implement time-based metrics (e.g., last 3-6 months) for dynamic credit scoring.
   - Provide actionable insights and strategies for effective credit risk mitigation.

## Project Structure
- **/data**: Raw and processed datasets used for analysis.
- **/notebooks**:  Interactive notebooks with detailed EDA, feature engineering, and credit score calculations. These notebooks are hosted on **Google Colab**, an easy-to-use, cloud-                      based platform that allows users to execute code, visualize data, and collaborate in real-time without requiring any local setup.
- **/src**: Python scripts for feature engineering, credit scoring, and visualizations.
- **/reports**: Final analysis and key insights derived from the project.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data analysis, with libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and calculating credit scores.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and insights presentation.
- **Colab Notebook**: For an interactive coding environment and analysis.
